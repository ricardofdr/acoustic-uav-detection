# acoustic-uav-detection
Acoustic-based UAV detection using deep learning (CNN/RNN), focused on real-time drone presence detection via audio signals.



## Introduction
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have become increasingly common over the years, thanks to their diverse applications and ease of deployment. Both in military applications and civil applications.


## Objectives
The main objective of this project is to train the model, enabling it to detect the presence of UAVs within its radius, based on the transmitted acoustic signal.


## Datasets
This project uses publicly available drone acoustic datasets:
  - [DroneAudioDataset](https://github.com/saraalemadi/DroneAudioDataset)
  - [DronePrint](https://github.com/DronePrint/DronePrint/tree/master)
