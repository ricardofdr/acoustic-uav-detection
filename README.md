# acoustic-uav-detection
Acoustic-based UAV detection using deep learning (CNN/RNN), focused on real-time drone presence detection via audio signals.



## Introduction
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have become increasingly common over the years, both in military and civil applications, thanks to their diverse applications and ease of deployment.


## Objectives
The main objective of this project is to train the model, enabling it to detect the presence of UAVs within its radius, based on the transmitted acoustic signal.


## Datasets
This project uses publicly available drone acoustic datasets:
  - [DroneAudioDataset](https://github.com/saraalemadi/DroneAudioDataset)
  - [DronePrint](https://github.com/DronePrint/DronePrint/tree/master)



## Notebooks
List of notebooks implemented:
  - *(to be updated)*

List of notebooks for future implementation:
  -  01_data_exploration - Inspection and understanding of raw data;
  -  02_feature_extraction - Transformation of audio into features;
  -  03_model_training - Model training;
  -  04_model_evaluation - Test and results analysis;
  -  05_prototype_test - Real-time or live experiments.
